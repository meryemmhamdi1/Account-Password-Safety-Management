### Acknowledgments </title>
This project was accomplished in Cryptography class under the supervision of  <b> Dr. Tajje-eddine Rachidi </b>.

### Project Description </title>
Managing user names and passwords for email, network, accounts etc. can be a real hassle. A secure password
solution consists in listing ones credentials (in the form of tuples <Title>,<Username>, <password>
<URL>,<Notes>) in a text file, then encrypting the entire file with a strong encryption algorithm requiring a
pass phrase. To retrieve/update ones credentials, one has to have both the encrypted textfile (.kdb) and the
secure password application at hand. This project implements a GUI based secure
password solution, using Java Cryptographic Extension (JCE), and Java GUI packages. Users need to key in
the passphrase to be able to retrieve, modify and delete tuples.
