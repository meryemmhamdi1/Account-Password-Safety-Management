This project was accomplished in Cryptography class under the supervision of  <b> Dr. Tajje-eddine Rachidi </b>.

<title> Project Description </title>
Managing user names and passwords for email, network, accounts etc. can be a real hassle. A secure password
solution consists in listing ones credentials (in the form of tuples <Title>,<Username>, <password>
<URL>,<Notes>) in a text file, then encrypting the entire file with a strong encryption algorithm requiring a
pass phrase. To retrieve/update ones credentials, one has to have both the encrypted textfile (.kdb) and the
secure password application at hand. In this project you are required to implement a GUI based secure
password solution, using Java Cryptographic Extension (JCE), and Java GUI packages. Users need to key in
the passphrase to be able to retrieve, modify and delete tuples. Every care should be given to the proper use
of the transformation of the passphrase to a security key. Beyond security, the application is expected to be functional, easy to use, and practical.
